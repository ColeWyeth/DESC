# Detection and Estimation of Structural Consistency (DESC)

## Introduction

DESC is an elegant quadratic programming approach to the problem of group synchronization. 

This repo contains matlab files for implementing the method of the following paper

Robust Group Synchronization via Quadratic Programming, Yunpeng Shi, Cole Wyeth, and Gilad Lerman, ICML 2022

## Usage

Download matlab files. 

Implementations of the algorithms in the paper appear in DESC_paper/Rotation_code/Algorithms. Results for synthetic data can be reproduced by running DESC_paper/Rotation_code/Exampes/synthetic_data_experiments.m. Results for real data experiments can be reproduced by loading phototourism data and running the scripts in DESC_paper/Real_Data_Experiments.

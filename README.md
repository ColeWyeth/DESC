Algorithms are named "CEMP_rotation_(name).m"
Current approaches include the original CEMP, CEMP simple, gradient descent (on a quadratic),
linear programming, and an analytical solution.
Data can be can be gathered using RunTests.mlx, which calls AutomatedTesting.mlx.
Data is in dated directories (e.g., Data0912). Each directory contains a detailed description
of the data inside and how it was generated.
